## Fling

**Fling** is a research platform for Federated Learning using PyTorch as backend. 

Its goal is to **simulate the distributed learning process of Federated Learning on single or multiple machines**, providing a **fair testing platform** for the performance of various federated learning algorithms on different datasets. It is mainly based on the Python language and uses the PyTorch framework as the backend module for deep learning, supporting a variety of federated learning algorithms and commonly used federated learning datasets.

It mainly supports:

- Generic Federated Learning methods, such as FedAvg.
- Personalized Federated Learning methods, such as FedPer.
- Attacking methods, such as DLG.

## Installation

Firstly, it is recommended to install PyTorch manually with a suitable version (specifically 1.1.0 or higher). However, using PyTorch version 2.0.0 or later is preferred due to its better computational efficiency. Instructions for installation can be found at this [link](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

After the first step, you can simply install the latest version of Fling with the following command by using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kxzxvbk/Fling
cd Fling
pip install -e .
```

Finally, you can use

```bash
fling -v
```

to check whether Fling is successfully installed.

## Quick Start

After successfully install Fling, users can start the first Fling experiment by using the following command. An example for generic federated learning:

```bash
python flzoo/mnist/mnist_fedavg_cnn_toy_config.py
```

Or using our cli util by:

```shell
fling run -c flzoo/mnist/mnist_fedper_cnn_toy_config.py -p personalized_model_pipeline
```

This config is a simplified version for conducting FedAvg on the dataset MNIST and iterate for 4 communication rounds.

For other algorithms and datasets, users can refer to `argzoo/` or customize your own configuration files.

For attacking methods, please refer to our examples in: [demo for attack](https://github.com/kxzxvbk/Fling/blob/main/fling/utils/attack_utils/demo)

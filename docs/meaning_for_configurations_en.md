# Meanings for Each Configuration Key

## Default Configuration Instance

In this document, we provide a complete configuration file and explain the meanings of each key.

Note that the following configuration file is exactly the default configuration file. In other words, if some keys do not exist in user-defined config, the value in the following file will be used by default.

Here is the default configuration file, you can also view it at [here](https://github.com/kxzxvbk/Fling/blob/main/argzoo/default_config.py) :

### learn.scheduler

This key controls the learning rate scheduler. Beside "fix", the key `learn.scheduler` has a variety of types. For example, we can define a scheduler using cosine function:

```python
scheduler=dict(
    # Cosine learning rate scheduler.
    name='cos'
    # The `min_lr` is the lower bound of learning rate.
    min_lr=1e-6,
    # This means that the learning rate will decay progressively for 30 global epochs and finally reaches `min_lr`.
    decay_round=30
)
```

For other types schedulers, please refer to `fling.utils.LRScheduler`.

### learn.finetune_parameters

This key controls what parameters should be finetuned. Beside "all", the key `learn.finetune_parameters` has other values. For example, if you only want to fine-tune parameters whose names **contain** keywords "fc" or "bn", you can write:

```python
finetune_parameters=dict(
    # This means to only fine-tune parameters whose names have keywords listed in `keywords`.
    name='contain',
    keywords=['fc', 'bn']
)
```

On the opposite, if you want to fine-tune parameters whose names **except** keywords "fc" or "bn", you can write:

```python
finetune_parameters=dict(
    # This means to only fine-tune parameters except those whose names have keywords listed in `keywords`.
    name='except',
    keywords=['fc', 'bn']
)
```

The setting for `group.aggregation_parameters` , which controls what parameters should be aggregated under the framework of Federated Learning, is similar.

To show the differences in meaning and usage between the parameters `learn.finetune_parameters` and `group.aggregation_parameters`, let's take the configuration file of the **FedPer** algorithm, [`cifar10_fedper_resnet_config.py`](https://github.com/kxzxvbk/Fling/blob/main/fling/dataset/cifar100.py), as an example. The definitions of these two parameters in the configuration file are as follows:

```python
exp_args = dict(
    learn=dict(
        # Only fine-tune parameters whose name contain the keyword "fc".
        finetune_parameters=dict(
            name='contain',
            keywords=['fc']),
    ),
    group=dict(
        # Only aggregate parameters whose name does not contain the keyword "fc".
        aggregation_parameters=dict(
            name='except',
            keywords=['fc'],
        ),
    )
)
```

In this setup for Federated Learning, the `group.aggregation_parameters` allows all clients to share parameters except those containing the "fc" keyword, while the `learn.finetune_parameters` parameter enables each client to fine-tune its own parameters that contain the "fc" keyword.

### launcher

- Beside "serial", the key `launcher.name` has other modes. On os other than Linux, the default configuration "serial" means that all operations on each client is executed serially, which can be not efficient enough. We can use the multiprocessing method to accelerate this process.
- On Linux system, the default `launcher.name` is "multiprocessing" and number of processes `num_proc=2`:

```python
launcher=dict(
    name='multiprocessing',
    num_proc=2
)
```

There are several things important:

1) For Windows users, this multiprocessing can be not stable due to the fact that multiprocessing + PyTorch does not support for Windows well. It may lead to unexpected bugs. If you meet any bugs related to multiprocessing on Windows, consider using the serial launcher instead.
2) Due to the new features of PyTorch 2.0, the compiled model does not currently support multiprocessing execution. In our design, if you enable the multiprocessing mode, the compilation of PyTorch will be disabled. This bug might be solved by PyTorch after this pr lands: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/101651
3) The `num_proc` refers to the number of processes used in the program. The optimal value of this value can be affected by the task you execute, the hardware you use, the neural network you employ, the data you use ...... You should tune this value carefully on your system and choose the best choice. Here is a simple benchmark on A100 with 4-core CPU, batch_size=32:

| num_proc          | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 8     |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| MNIST + CNN       | 21.7s | 14.9s | 15.3s | 16.5s | 25.2s |
| CIFAR10 + ResNet8 | 45.2s | 32.1s | 30.1s | 32.5s | 40.4s |

### data.transforms

- The key `include_default` refers to whether include the default data augmentation methods. For example, if you are using the CIFAR100 dataset and set `include_default=True`. The exact data transforms you use is

```python
transforms=dict(
    horizontal_flip=dict(p=0.5),
    random_rotation=dict(degree=15),
    Normalize=dict(mean=[0.507, 0.487, 0.441], std=[0.267, 0.256, 0.276]),
    random_crop=dict(size=32, padding=4),
)
```

, which is defined in the default augmentation [`fling/dataset/cifar100.py`](https://github.com/kxzxvbk/Fling/blob/main/fling/dataset/cifar100.py). Note that for different datasets, the default augmentations can be different and can be even None.

- If users want to disable the default transforms, just use `include_default=False` and define your own methods:

```python
transforms=dict(
    include_default=False,
    # The following is optional.
    horizontal_flip=dict(p=0.5)
)
```

- Users can also overwrite the default transforms like this:

```python
transforms=dict(
    include_default=True,
    # Overwrite
    horizontal_flip=dict(p=0.3)
)
```

For CIFAR100, this code is equivalent to:

```python
transforms=dict(
    horizontal_flip=dict(p=0.3),
    random_rotation=dict(degree=15),
    Normalize=dict(mean=[0.507, 0.487, 0.441], std=[0.267, 0.256, 0.276]),
    random_crop=dict(size=32, padding=4),
)
```
